Part of this is because the design spec for these models is less strict (we're not copying over weights from a pretrained model like last time, all that matters is that our model actually trains correctly, and so small changes to the solution architecture can sometimes be allowed). However, another part is that we're trying to move participants away from being too reliant on unit tests, and towards being able to independently reason through exercises or replications given just a description of the task or a paper implementation to follow.

        "\n",
        "Autoencoders are a relatively simple architecture, at least compared to GANs: you learn a compressed representation of your data (mainly using linear layers and convolutions), then reconstruct it back into an image (with linear layers and transposed convolutions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Although autoencoders can learn some interesting low-dimensional representations, they are less good for generating images because their latent spaces aren't generally meaningful. This leads to VAEs, which solve this problem by having their encoders map to a distribution over latent vectors, rather than a single latent vector. This incentivises the latent space to be more meaningful, and we can more easily generate images from sample vectors in this space.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start with some reading material on autoencoders and transposed convolutions (which are often used in parallel with convolutions, to take a latent space and map it back into a full-size image). Then, we actually implement and train VAEs to generate MNIST images, as well as a do a bit of exploring our our autoencoders' latent spaces.\n",

        "Relative to autoencoders, GANs have a few more moving pieces in their architecture. They're best thought of as two separate networks (the generator and the discriminator) which are learning different goals simultaneously. The goal of the generator is to create images which fool the discriminator, and the goal of the discriminator is to distinguish between real and fake images. The ideal equilibrium point of training is when the generator produces perfect images and the discriminator can't tell the difference between real and fake - however, that's much simpler said than done! GANs are notoriously difficult to train, and we'll have to engage with some of these difficulties during our exercises.\n",

You can use it exactly the same way you use normal convolutional layers: for instance `ConvTranspose2d(32, 16, 4, stride=2, padding=1)` will define a convolution layer that maps a tensor from `(batch_size, in_channels=32, height, width)` up to shape `(batch_size, out_channels=16, height * 2, width * 2)`.\n",

For example, much of the middle region is just an unrecognisable blob. Using the default interpolation range of `(-1, 1)` makes things look even worse.

To further illustrate this, the code below feeds MNIST data into your encoder, and plots the resulting latent vectors (projected along the first two latent dimensions). Note that there are some very high-density spots, and other much lower-density spots. So it stands to reason that we shouldn't expect the decoder to be able to produce good output for all points in the latent space (especially when we're using a 5-dimensional latent space rather than just 2-dimensional as visualised below - we can imagine that 5D latent space would have significantly more \"dead space\").\n",

However, if we use a variational autoencoder, we don't have this problem. The output of a linear interpolation between the cluster of $2$s and cluster of $7$s will be ***\"a symbol which pattern-matches to the family of MNIST digits, but has equal probability to be interpreted as a $2$ or a $7$\"***, and this is indeed what we find.\n",

We know how to differentiate with respect to the inputs to a function, but how can we differentiate wrt the parameters of a probability distribution from which we sample our vector? The solution is to convert our random sampling into a function, by introducing an extra parameter $\\epsilon$. We sample $\\epsilon$ from the standard normal distribution, and then express $\\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of $\\mu$, $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$:\n",

This is why it's important to add a KL-divergence term to the loss function, to make sure this doesn't happen. It's also why, if you print out the average value of $\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})$ while training, you'll probably see it stay below 1 (it's being pulled towards 1 by the KL-divergence loss, **and** pulled towards 0 by the reconstruction loss).\n",

On the other hand, $\\beta$ being too small means we just reduce to the autoencoder case where the model has no incentive to make meaningful use of the latent space.

        "## How GANs work\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind GANs is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You have two networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**.\n",
        "* The generator's job is to produce output realistic enough to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator's job is to try and tell the difference between real and fake output.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is for both networks to be trained simultaneously, in a positive feedback loop: as the generator produces better output, the discriminator's job becomes harder, and it has to learn to spot more subtle features distinguishing real and fake images, meaning the generator has to work harder to produce images with those features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Discriminator\n",
        "\n",
        "The discriminator works by taking an image (either real, or created by the generator), and outputting a single value between 0 and 1, which is the probability that the discriminator puts on the image being real. The discriminator sees the images, but not the labels (i.e. whether the images are real or fake), and it is trained to distinguish between real and fake images with maximum accuracy. The discriminator's loss function is the cross entropy between its probability estimates ($D(x)$ for real images, $D(G(z))$ for fake images) and the true labels ($1$ for real images, $0$ for fake images).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generator\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of generators in a GAN setup is generally a mirror image of the discriminator, with convolutions swapped out for **transposed convolutions**. This is the case for the DCGAN paper we'll be reading (which is why they only give a diagram of the generator, not both). The generator works by taking in a vector $z$, whose elements are all normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1. We call the space from which $z$ is sampled **latent dimension** or **latent space**, and we call $z$ a **latent vector**. The formal definition of a latent space is *an abstract multi-dimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.* We'll dive a little deeper into what this means and the overall significance of latent spaces later on, but for now it's fine to understand this vector $z$ as a kind of random seed, which causes the generator to produce different outputs. After all, if the generator only ever produced the same image as output then the discriminator's job would be pretty easy (just subtract the image $g$ always produces from the input image, and see if the result is close to zero!). The generator's objective function is an increasing function of $D(G(z))$, in other words it tries to produce images $G(z)$ which have a high chance of fooling the discriminator (i.e. $D(G(z)) \\approx 1$).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Convergence\n",
        "\n",
        "The ideal outcome when training a GAN is for the generator to produce perfect output indistinguishable from real images, and the discriminator just guesses randomly. However, the precise nature of the situations when GANs converge is an ongoing area of study (in general, adversarial networks have very unstable training patterns). For example, you can imagine a situation where the discriminator becomes almost perfect at spotting fake outputs, because of some feature that the discriminator spots and that the generator fails to capture in its outputs. It will be very difficult for the generator to get a training signal, because it has to figure out what feature is missing from its outputs, and how it can add that feature to fool the discriminator. And to make matters worse, maybe marginal steps in that direction will only increase the probability of fooling the discriminator from almost-zero to slightly-more-than-almost-zero, which isn't much of a training signal! Later on we will see techniques people have developed to overcome problems like this and others, but in general they can't be solved completely.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is necessary for the generator to be producing perfect outputs, because otherwise the discriminator could do better than random guessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the generator is producing perfect outputs, then the discriminator never has any ability to distinguish real from fake images, so it has no information. Its job is to minimise the cross entropy between its output distribution $(D(x), 1-D(x))$, and the distribution of real/fake images. Call this $(p, 1-p)$, i.e. $p$ stands for the proportion of images in training which are real. Note how we just used $p$ rather than $p(x)$, because there's no information in the image $x$ which indicates whether it is real or fake. Trying to minimize the cross entropy between $(p, 1-p)$ and $(D(x), 1-D(x))$ gives us the solution $D(x) = p$ for all $x$. In other words, our discriminator guesses real/fake randomly with probability equal to the true underlying frequency of real/fake images in the data. This is 0.5 if and only if the data contains an equal number of real and fake images.\n",

The idea is that you clip the gradients of your weights to some fixed threshold during backprop, and use these clipped gradients to update the weights. This can be done using [`nn.utils.clip_grad_norm`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html), which is called between the `loss.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` methods (since it directly modifies the `.grad` attributes of your weights). You shouldn't find this absolutely necessary to train your models, however it might help to clip the gradients to a value like `1.0` for your generator & discriminator. We've given you this as an optional parameter to use in your `DCGANArgs` dataclass."

Although it varies depending on details of the hardware and dataset & model you're training with, at least for these exercises if your generator's output doesn't resemble anything like a face after the first epoch, then something's probably going wrong in your code."
